Asynchronous HTTP Server: aiohttp
Asynchronous SQL Server:  aiosql

I need a Web Server that reads page_*.py files.
These files are suppose to be very minimal and able to directly affect server.
For example: able to list all pages, add new pages, remove pages and more.
I would like that these pages would ideally not require import statements.
The print("""Hello World""") statement should be main way to .




Instead of trying to come up with a statement like show() or replacing print() it's better to use templates system. But I'm not sure.
